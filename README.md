This is an activity the class of mcu 8051.The goal is to program an AT89C51RD2 (8051) microcontroller, to make an aplication, which is a communication between a PC and the microcontroller.

So to do this, I will put in this repository step by step of my programming.Let's get started !!!

## Steps

  - Base code
  - Receiving test
